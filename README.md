## 🧹 Cleaning Tasks Performed

### ✅ 1. Removed Duplicates
Identified and removed duplicate rows based on all columns in the table to ensure data uniqueness.

### ✅ 2. Standardized Data
Cleaned up inconsistencies by removing extra spaces and unifying similar text values (e.g., different spellings or formats of the same company name).

### ✅ 3. Handled Null and Blank Values
Reviewed critical columns and removed or corrected records with null or blank values to maintain data integrity.

### ✅ 4. Converted Data Types
Transformed the `date` column from text format to a proper date type for more accurate filtering and analysis.

### ✅ 5. Dropped Unnecessary Columns
Removed irrelevant or redundant columns that did not contribute to the final dataset, improving performance and readability.
